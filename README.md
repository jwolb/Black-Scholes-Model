# Black-Scholes-Model

While studying for the CFA level 2 exam this file may be useful to practice. I created this as a way to practice an unlimited amount of BS questions as this was one of the most difficult topics. The BS model for level 2 should be easy to answer once you get through many questions. Good Luck studying.
