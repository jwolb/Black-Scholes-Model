# Black-Scholes-Model

While studying for the CFA level 2 exam this file may be useful to practice. I created this as a way to practice an unlimited amount of BS questions as this was one of the most difficult topics. The BS model for level 2 should be easy to answer once you get through many questions. Just run this on the command prompt and you can extract random calls or puts examples with answers. You may also use your own examples if you select manual call or put as your input in the command prompt.

Good Luck Studying.
